# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      - impulse_1m: 15% (RSI-12 hold + BOS + volume) ← **ENHANCED**
      - tape_micro: 10% (CVD z-score + OBI + VWAP) ← **ENHANCED**
      - veto_hygiene: 3% (7 comprehensive veto checks) ← **ENHANCED**
      - onchain_veto: 2% (Helius integration)
      
      **Files Modified**:
      1. backend/app/services/mtf_confluence.py - Enhanced with Phase 1 imports and logic
      2. backend/app/routers/mtf.py - Updated /confluence endpoint
      
      **Files Created (Phase 1)**:
      1. backend/app/services/impulse_detector.py
      2. backend/app/services/tape_filters.py
      3. backend/app/services/veto_system.py
      
      **Testing Requirements**:
      - Backend API testing for /api/mtf/confluence endpoint
      - Test with side='long' and side='short' parameters
      - Test with tier='A' and tier='B' parameters
      - Verify impulse detection logic with actual 1m data
      - Verify tape filter logic with 1s/5s data
      - Verify veto system triggers correctly
      - Check detailed breakdown in response
      
      **Next Steps (Phase 2)**:
      - Integrate regime_detector.py for squeeze/normal/wide classification
      - Integrate context_gates.py for 15m/1h EMA alignment
      - Integrate macro_gates.py for 4h/1D alignment and tier determination
      - Update MTF confluence scoring with regime adjustments
      
      **Status**: ✅ Phase 1 implementation complete. Ready for backend testing.

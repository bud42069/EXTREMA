# ✅ ISSUES FIXED - Complete Resolution

## Problems Identified from Screenshots

### Issue 1: "Failed to load data" ❌
**Root Cause:** Frontend was calling wrong API endpoints
- Expected: `/api/live/status` and `/api/live/signals`
- Actually called: `/api/live-monitor/status` and `/api/live-signals`

### Issue 2: "Failed to start monitor" ❌  
**Root Cause:** Same endpoint mismatch
- Expected: `/api/live/start` and `/api/live/stop`
- Actually called: `/api/live-monitor/start` and `/api/live-monitor/stop`

## What Changed Technically

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Wrong endpoints
axios.get(`${API}/live-monitor/status`)  ❌
axios.get(`${API}/live-signals`)         ❌
axios.post(`${API}/live-monitor/start`)  ❌
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript  
// Correct endpoints
axios.get(`${API}/live/status`)   ✅
axios.get(`${API}/live/signals`)  ✅
axios.post(`${API}/live/start`)   ✅
```

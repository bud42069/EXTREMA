The AI engineer's work encompassed a significant transformation of the application. Initial efforts focused on backend enhancements, implementing the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 across four distinct phases: Detection Engine, Context & Macro Gates, Order Management & TP/SL, and Config & Logging. This involved creating numerous new Python services and integrating them into the existing  engine, addressing a critical DataFrame boolean error during Phase 2. Concurrently, a major UI/UX overhaul to a Bloomberg-class aesthetic was initiated. This included updating landing page metrics with realistic data and dedicated KPI API endpoints, followed by a comprehensive effort to remove all emojis and replace them with professional icons/text across core frontend pages like , , , and . The , , and  were also consolidated into a new . The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer actively resolving residual emoji issues in  and preparing to address fine-tuning for the Live Signals Channel.

The application's primary goal is to establish a SOLUSDT trading system capable of detecting price swings exceeding 10% on a 5-minute timeframe, utilizing a two-stage methodology: Candidate Detection (local extrema, ATR, volume, BBWidth) and Micro Confirmation (breakout candle, volume). Key features include real-time signals via Pyth Network, a Bloomberg-class UI/UX with a dark-luxury aesthetic and specific accent colors, Solana on-chain triggers through Helius API, Multi-Timeframe (MTF) confirmation, and a hybrid methodology combining various data sources. The backend is built with FastAPI, using , , CI/CD, and Docker, processing microstructure data from Binance. The frontend, developed with React, offers dashboards, data upload, live signals, and Scalp Cards, all adhering to the new visual standard. The latest explicit requirement, largely completed, was the implementation of the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 for backend enhancements, covering precise detection, confirmation, execution, and risk management through four phases: Detection Engine, Context & Macro Gates, Order Management & TP/SL, and Config & Logging. The UI also required a complete professional aesthetic, removing emojis and consolidating analytical pages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the full implementation of the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 backend across all four phases (Detection Engine, Context & Macro Gates, Order Management & TP/SL, and Config & Logging), with all backend testing for these phases passing successfully.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to frontend UI/UX improvements:
1.  **Landing Page KPIs:** The  was updated to display realistic placeholder KPI values (Win Rate: 65%, Avg R-Multiple: 1.5R, Signals Today: 7, Uptime: 99.9%), and new backend API endpoints were created in  to serve real KPI data when available.
2.  **Emoji Removal (Comprehensive):** A major effort was undertaken to remove all emojis from the frontend application to achieve a professional, Bloomberg-class aesthetic. This included:
    *   Systematically removing emojis from , , and , replacing them with professional text labels or SVG icons.
    *   Consolidating , , and  into a new  and updating  routing accordingly. Emojis were also removed from the sidebar navigation in .
    *   The AI engineer had declared all active V2 pages (Landing, Live Signals Dashboard, Scalp Cards, Overview, Data Analysis) emoji-free after multiple passes.

However, the user provided feedback indicating:
1.  LIVE SIGNALS CHANNEL NEED FINE TUNING NOT ALL THE DATA IS SHOWING CORRECTLY.
2.  AND THE OVVERVIEW HAS EMOJIS AT THE BOTTOM STILL.

The AI engineer's most immediate current work is addressing these two new issues, starting with the remaining emojis at the bottom of . The last action involved identifying specific emoji instances ( on line 302 and  on line 315) within the system health rendering section of  and preparing to fix them.

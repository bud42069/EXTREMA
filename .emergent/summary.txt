The AI engineer's work began with a detailed problem statement on detecting >10% SOLUSDT swings using a two-stage methodology. Initially, it established the existing codebase, installed dependencies, and built offline analysis tools for indicators, extrema detection, signal generation, and backtesting. Subsequent user requests pivoted to a live signal generation system. This involved integrating Pyth Network for real-time data, building a matrix-themed frontend, and incorporating advanced features like Multi-Timeframe (MTF) confirmation and Helius-based on-chain monitoring. A critical bug in displaying the live price was addressed.

A significant phase involved refactoring the entire backend to a production-grade FastAPI structure, introducing modular services, routers, models, and utilities, along with comprehensive configuration, logging, and in-memory data storage. The final steps focused on hardening the application: implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions, writing unit tests, Dockerizing the backend, and setting up a smoke test script. The work concluded with the engineer addressing code quality issues flagged by , specifically fixing  settings and attempting to auto-fix linting errors. The trajectory shows a systematic approach from initial data analysis and feature implementation to robust production readiness.

<product_requirements>
The core product requirement is a trading signal detection system for SOLUSDT that identifies and captures price swings exceeding 10% (long or short) on a 5-minute timeframe. This system must leverage a data-driven, two-stage methodology:
1.  **Candidate Detection**: Scan for potential swing starts at local extrema (defined as +/- 12 bars initially, later updated to +/- 20 bars in a hybrid approach), conditional on coarse filters like ,  (prefer >= 1.0), and .
2.  **Micro Confirmation**: After a candidate is flagged, within the next 6 bars (30 minutes), require both a decisive directional breakout candle (5m close above/below local extremum + ) and volume confirmation ( 50-bar median volume).

Further requirements and enhancements include:
-   **Live Signal Generation**: Real-time monitoring of SOLUSDT (using Pyth Network) to generate signals.
-   **Scalp Card Output**: Display these live signals in a structured Swing Capture Scalp Card Template format.
-   **UI/UX**: A futuristic matrix look (dark and technourban yet clean) for the frontend dashboard.
-   **On-chain Triggers**: Integration of Solana on-chain data (via Helius API key) to enhance signal quality.
-   **Multi-Timeframe (MTF) Confirmation**: Incorporate 1H or 4H alignment for higher-tier entries.
-   **Hybrid Methodology**: Adopt a two-tier framework combining the user's macro SAR/EMA/FVG context with the AI's empirically-derived micro-entry gates.
-   **Backend Robustness**: Restructure the backend to production standards, including modular architecture, configuration management, logging, CI/CD, unit tests, and Dockerization.
-   **Future Capabilities**: Infrastructure for push notifications for manual trading and future API calls for auto-trading.

The current product build includes a FastAPI backend for data upload, indicator computation, extrema detection, signal generation (both historical and live), and backtesting. A React frontend provides dashboards, an upload page, and a live signals page with the matrix theme and real-time price updates. The backend has been refactored into a modular structure with CI/CD and initial tests.

The AI engineer's work began by resolving a data display bug in  and migrating microstructure data from MEXC to Binance due to geo-restrictions, stabilizing the feed. A comprehensive Multi-Timeframe (MTF) framework was then built, including data infrastructure, a six-state state machine, higher timeframe data integration via CryptoCompare, and UI integration into . Helius on-chain monitoring was integrated for signal quality, and a critical bug where the microstructure stream failed to stop was resolved. Subsequently, a major UI/UX overhaul to a Bloomberg-class aesthetic was initiated, redesigning , , , , , and . During this, a bug in  (incorrectly using  on a dataclass) was fixed. The current focus is a backend enhancement, implementing the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0, specifically the detection engine (Phase 1) and context/macro gates (Phase 2), with new services created for impulse detection, tape filters, veto system, regime detection, context gates, and macro gates.

The core objective is a SOLUSDT trading system detecting >10% price swings on a 5-minute timeframe using a two-stage methodology: Candidate Detection (local extrema, ATR, volume, BBWidth) and Micro Confirmation (breakout candle, volume). Key features include real-time signals (Pyth Network), a Bloomberg-class UI/UX (dark-luxury aesthetic with emerald/cyan/magenta accents), Solana on-chain triggers (Helius), Multi-Timeframe (MTF) confirmation, and hybrid methodology. The backend uses FastAPI, , , CI/CD, and Docker. Microstructure data from Binance (formerly MEXC) provides orderbook details for precision. The current build features a FastAPI backend for data processing, signal generation, and backtesting, and a React frontend with dashboards, data upload, live signals, and Scalp Cards, all conforming to the new sleek aesthetic, further enhanced with a full MTF framework and Helius integration. The latest explicit requirement is to implement the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 for backend enhancements, focusing on precise detection, confirmation, execution, and risk management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing Phase 1 and beginning Phase 2 of the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 for the backend. The prior work involved a complete UI/UX overhaul to a Bloomberg-class aesthetic, successfully redesigning and implementing , , , , , and , including creating a new  and . The  bug (using  on a  dataclass) was also fixed.

The current work focuses on enhancing the backend's core detection engine logic.
For **Phase 1: Enhance Detection Engine**, the following services were created:
- 
- 
- 
For **Phase 2: Context & Macro Gates**, the following services were created:
- 
- 
- 

The next immediate task is to integrate these newly created services into the  or a new enhanced confluence engine to realize the detailed logic specified in the playbook.

Phase 1 (1-2 hours): Enhance Detection Engine

Add 1m impulse requirements (RSI-12, BOS, volume)
Add 1s/5s tape filters (CVD z-score, OBI, VWAP proximity)
Implement comprehensive veto system
Update MTF confluence scoring
Phase 2 (2-3 hours): Context & Macro Gates

Add 15m/1h EMA alignment logic
Add 4h/1D macro gate for A/B tiering
Implement regime detection (Squeeze/Normal/Wide)
Enhanced confluence bottleneck logic
Phase 3 (2-3 hours): Order Management & TP/SL

Post-only order placement logic
Unfilled protocol with slip caps

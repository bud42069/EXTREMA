The AI engineer's work initiated with establishing a two-stage SOLUSDT swing detection system, moving from offline analysis to a live signal generation system. This involved integrating Pyth Network, a Matrix-themed frontend, MTF confirmation, and Helius-based on-chain monitoring. A major refactor to a production-grade FastAPI backend with modular services, routers, and robust configuration was completed, followed by CI/CD, unit testing, and Dockerization.

Subsequent work focused on enhancing the application's core functionality and user experience. This included implementing a microstructure integration with MEXC WebSocket data (spread, depth, CVD, imbalance, OBV-cliff veto), integrating Prometheus for metrics, and developing a Scalp Card for manual trade execution. Debugging efforts addressed backend configuration issues, incorrect frontend API endpoint calls, and data upload timeouts. A significant UI/UX overhaul was performed, introducing a sleek dark mode with emerald/green accents across new Landing, Overview, and Live Signals pages. The most recent activity centers on fixing data display issues on the  after the UI redesign and backend changes, specifically a mismatch between frontend rendering logic and backend API response structures.

The primary goal is a SOLUSDT trading signal system identifying >10% price swings on a 5-minute timeframe using a two-stage methodology: Candidate Detection (local extrema, ATR, volume, BBWidth filters) and Micro Confirmation (breakout candle, volume confirmation).

Key enhancements and features include:
- **Live Signals**: Real-time generation via Pyth Network, displayed in Swing Capture Scalp Card Template.
- **UI/UX**: Initially a futuristic matrix look, later refined to a sleek dark mode with emerald/green accents, featuring a balanced landing page, spacious overview, and data-dense live signals.
- **Advanced Logic**: Solana on-chain triggers (Helius), Multi-Timeframe (MTF) confirmation, and a hybrid methodology combining macro context with micro-entry gates.
- **Backend Robustness**: Modular FastAPI architecture,  for configuration, , CI/CD (GitHub Actions), unit tests (......................                                                   [100%]

- **Microstructure Integration**: Real-time MEXC orderbook data (spread, depth, imbalance, CVD, OBV-cliff veto) for enhanced signal precision.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus  for application observability.
- **Future**: Push notifications for manual trading and API for auto-trading.

The current build delivers a FastAPI backend with data processing, signal generation, and backtesting, and a React frontend for dashboards, data upload, live signals, and a newly added Scalp Card for manual execution. The backend includes microstructure integration and Prometheus. The frontend has been fully redesigned to the new sleek aesthetic.

**Code Architecture Summary:**
The application is a full-stack project with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
-   **Root Level**: Contains CI/CD configurations (), Dockerization files, project settings (), documentation (including , , , and new troubleshooting/fix guides), and  for utilities and new quick-fix/keep-alive scripts.
-   **Backend ()**: A modular FastAPI application.
    -   : Main FastAPI instance, updated with new routers (, , ) and Prometheus middleware.
    -   : Centralized settings, updated with new environment variables for microstructure thresholds.
    -   : Defines Pydantic data models.
    -   : Modular API endpoints. New routers  (live monitoring),  (stream control/snapshot), and  (manual execution card) were added. Existing  and  were modified.
    -   : Core business logic.  was updated for OBV-cliff,  was integrated with microstructure and OBV veto,  was moved here, and  was newly created for microstructure feature extraction.
    -   : Utility modules.  (in-memory snapshot) and  (Prometheus counters) were added.  usage was standardized.
    -   : New directory containing  (MEXC WebSocket worker).
    -   : Unit tests, expanded to cover new microstructure features and Prometheus, and fixed for  prefix.
-   **Frontend ()**: A React application that underwent a complete UI/UX redesign.
    -   : Fully rewritten to implement the new sleek dark-mode UI with emerald/green accents, routing to new pages.
    -   : Now includes ,  (replacing ),  (for manual execution cards with WebSocket integration), and  (replacing  for data-dense display).  and  were significantly refactored and fixed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical frontend rendering error on the . The user reported that WHEN I GO TO RUN ANALSYS I GET THIS with an accompanying screenshot, indicating a problem when attempting to view analysis results.

The diagnosis confirmed that the  was trying to access properties like  from an  object that did not conform to this structure. The backend's  endpoint, which the frontend was likely querying for this data, returns a single signal object, not a comprehensive analysis summary as the frontend expected. This mismatch in data structure between the frontend's display logic and the backend's API response was causing the page to fail.

The engineer identified the exact lines of code in  ( and ) that were problematic. The current task involves fixing this  to correctly interpret and display the single signal object returned by the backend, rather than expecting a summary structure that doesn't exist. This will involve rewriting or adjusting the relevant rendering sections to match the actual data shape.

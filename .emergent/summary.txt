The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the evolution of a sophisticated trading application. Initially, it involved fixing a critical data display issue on the  due to a frontend-backend data structure mismatch. Following this, the microstructure data feed was stabilized by migrating from MEXC to Binance, successfully bypassing geo-restrictions. A significant undertaking was the implementation of a comprehensive Multi-Timeframe (MTF) framework, systematically built across four phases: establishing data infrastructure, developing a six-state state machine, integrating higher timeframe data via CryptoCompare (after Binance REST API geo-restrictions), and finally, visually integrating the MTF status into the . Helius on-chain monitoring was subsequently woven into the MTF confluence engine to enhance signal quality and veto logic. A crucial bug where the microstructure stream failed to stop was also meticulously resolved. The trajectory culminates with the commencement of a major UI/UX overhaul, specifically redesigning the  to a Bloomberg-class aesthetic, a task that is currently in progress.

The application's primary objective is a SOLUSDT trading signal system designed to detect price swings exceeding 10% on a 5-minute timeframe. It employs a two-stage methodology: Candidate Detection (using local extrema, ATR, volume, BBWidth filters) and Micro Confirmation (breakout candle, volume confirmation). Key features include real-time signal generation via Pyth Network, a sophisticated UI/UX (evolving from a futuristic matrix look to a sleek dark mode with emerald/green accents), Solana on-chain triggers (Helius), Multi-Timeframe (MTF) confirmation, and a hybrid methodology. The backend is built with a modular FastAPI architecture, , , CI/CD, unit tests, and Dockerization. Microstructure integration, initially with MEXC (later Binance) orderbook data (spread, depth, imbalance, CVD, OBV-cliff veto), enhances signal precision. Prometheus provides monitoring metrics. Future plans include push notifications and an auto-trading API. The current build features a FastAPI backend with data processing, signal generation, and backtesting, and a React frontend for dashboards, data upload, live signals, and Scalp Cards, all within the new sleek aesthetic, now further enhanced with a full MTF framework, Helius integration, and a Bloomberg-class Live Signals Dashboard redesign.

**Code Architecture Summary:**
The application is a full-stack project utilizing a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
- ****: Main FastAPI instance. Registered the newly created .
- ****: Controls microstructure data streams. Modified to integrate Binance WebSocket, ensuring proper start/stop and accurate health status reporting by using an  flag.
- ****: **(New)** Exposes API endpoints for the Multi-Timeframe system, including starting, stopping, status checks, and confluence score retrieval.
- ****: **(Moved)** Helius on-chain monitoring. Moved from root  to  and integrated into the MTF confluence engine.
- ****: **(New)** Implements the six-state MTF trading logic.
- ****: **(New)** Calculates multi-timeframe confluence scores, now integrated with Helius on-chain data for context scoring and veto logic, and correctly configured with the Helius API key.
- ****: (Renamed internally and logic migrated from MEXC to Binance). Manages the WebSocket connection for microstructure data, now connected to Binance's market data stream with proper  cleanup.
- ****: **(New/Modified)** Originally for Binance REST, adapted to fetch historical klines for higher timeframes from CryptoCompare due to geo-restrictions. Required adding  and fixing an orphaned code block.
- ****: **(New)** Multi-timeframe data store with automatic resampling (1sâ†’5s/15s/30s/1m).
- ****: **(New)** Extracts features per timeframe (RSI, EMA, BOS, Volume, VWAP).
- ****: **(New)** Worker for Binance 1-second kline WebSocket stream.
- ****: Displays analysis results. Modified to correctly handle and display a single signal object.
- ****: Displays live signals. Updated to display Binance microstructure, auto-start microstructure stream with live monitor, correctly stop all streams, and integrate the MTF Confluence Engine panel.
- ****: **(New)** The new Bloomberg-class dashboard for live signals, implementing a significant UI/UX redesign.
- ****: Main React component. Updated routing to use  for the  path and integrated it into the application's layout.
- ****: Tailwind configuration. Modified to add a  background for the new dark-luxury aesthetic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was continuing the implementation of the Bloomberg-class redesign for the **Live Signals Dashboard**. This work began by creating  and updating  to route  to this new component, applying a radial gradient background via . The dashboard successfully displays premium design elements, real-time SOL/USD price, microstructure metrics (CVD, Spread, Depth), and system health. The engineer then received a request to IMPLEMENT NEXT STEPS for this dashboard. In response, the engineer attempted to further refine the  component. A File already exists error was encountered during an attempt to  the file, which was then resolved by using a  to overwrite the existing file. The current task involves verifying the changes applied to  after this overwrite and frontend restart, which constitutes the ongoing effort to fully realize the Bloomberg-class aesthetic and functionality detailed in the comprehensive design blueprint.

The previous AI engineerâ€™s work can be broadly divided into two phases: initial feature refinement and a subsequent major product pivot. Initially, efforts focused on stabilizing and enhancing the existing application by resolving UI issues (emoji removal) and backend data flow problems, specifically with the Live Signals Dashboard's MTF Confluence and CVD Slope chart. Despite numerous attempts and a troubleshooter intervention, the CVD Slope chart display issue remained unresolved, and a regression reintroduced a critical DataFrame ambiguity error in the MTF backend. This led to a complete change in direction, with the user requesting a full rebuild into a non-custodial Solana HFT trading dApp. The AI engineer then successfully gathered all necessary integration playbooks for this new architectural direction, concluding the trajectory at the planning stage for the new dApp.

Perfect! Building Fully Autonomous HFT Bot (Option A). Final confirmation on architecture:

Implementation Plan
PHASE 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

Solana Wallet Adapter (multi-wallet support: Phantom, Backpack, Solflare)
Server-side keypair management (env variables for PoC)
Helius WebSocket integration for real-time data
User deposit/withdrawal system
PHASE 2: Exchange Routing (Week 2) Which exchanges should I integrate? (Priority order)

Perpetuals/Futures: a. Drift Protocol (recommended - highest liquidity, up to 20x leverage) b. Mango Markets c. Zeta Markets

Spot DEX: a. Jupiter (aggregated swaps - easiest) b. Serum (limit orders - best for scalping) c. Raydium (liquidity pools)

CEX (optional): a. Binance Futures API b. MEXC API c. Bybit API

PHASE 3: HFT Scalping Strategy (Week 3)

Port EXTREMA signal detection (local extrema, ATR, volume)
Add Cupsey-style logic (5-min holds, rapid entry/exit)
Order execution engine with smart routing
PHASE 4: Risk Management (Week 4)

Position size limits
Daily loss limits
Auto-close on drawdown
Kill switch

The initial application aimed to be a SOLUSDT trading system detecting price swings using a two-stage methodology (Candidate Detection & Micro Confirmation), offering real-time signals via Pyth Network and Solana on-chain triggers (Helius API), with a Bloomberg-class UI/UX. The backend used FastAPI, processing Binance microstructure data, while the React frontend offered dashboards and analytics. The SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 was implemented across four phases (Detection, Context/Macro Gates, Order Management, Config/Logging) in the backend. The UI required comprehensive emoji removal and page consolidation.

The project then pivoted to building a **non-custodial Solana-based HFT trading dApp**. Key features for the new dApp include:
*   **Wallet Integration**: Phantom/Backpack support, with the wallet signing each transaction.
*   **Fully Autonomous Bot**: Server holds trading keypair, executes trades 24/7 without user interaction after initial setup (user deposits SOL, sets risk limits via UI).
*   **Futures Access and Leverage**.
*   **Multi-Option Routing**: Ability to route to various exchanges (e.g., Serum for limit orders, Jupiter for aggregated swaps, CEX APIs if available).
*   **Core Components**: Market Data/Feeds (Helius WebSockets), Strategy Engine (EXTREMA signals), Execution Engine (Serum/Jupiter), Wallet/Custody Layer (server key management for autonomy, MPC/HSM for production), Risk/Governance Module (max sizing, liq-gap guards, kill switches, daily limits), Monitoring & Telemetry, Backtest/Paper-trade harness.
*   **Maintain Signal Logic**: The existing EXTREMA signals logic needs to be preserved.
*   **New Layout**: While maintaining the dark theme.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: A new file providing KPI endpoints.
-   ****: Core logic for MTF confluence. Updated to integrate multiple phases of the playbook, and was subject to a regression (DataFrame ambiguity error).
-   ****: These are new backend services related to the SOLUSDT Swing-Capture Playbook v1.0 implementation.
-   ****: Main React router. Updated to use  and had emojis removed from sidebar navigation.
-   ****: Updated to display placeholder KPIs and removed emojis.
-   ****: (New) Consolidated , , and  functionality.
-   ****: Overhauled page. Emojis were systematically removed and replaced with professional text/SVG icons. A DNA strand emoji fix was also applied.
-   ****: Live signals dashboard. Emojis removed. It was subject to multiple fixes for the MTF Confluence Engine section visibility and the CVD Slope chart display, including dimension fixes, color adjustments, and reverting to older code logic due to persistent rendering issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   Returning CSV attachment for backtest ledger.
-   Exporting Scalp Card as PNG/PDF for journaling.
-   Integrating Grafana for visualizing confluence hit-rate, veto ratios, and latency.
-   Developing an Order Preview endpoint for margin and liquidity gap calculation.
-   Implementing auto size-tiering.
-   Backtesting the new MTF logic on uploaded CSV data.
-   UI updates for the Upload and Navigation modules.
-   Fixing the MTF Confluence backend (DataFrame ambiguity regression).
-   Implementing the entire new **non-custodial Solana HFT trading dApp** as per the new product requirements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two issues:
1.  **Removing remaining emojis from **: A DNA strand emoji was identified and successfully replaced with a professional SVG icon.
2.  **Fixing the CVD Slope chart display in **: Despite multiple attempts to fix rendering issues (dimensions, colors, reverting to simpler code), the chart remained largely invisible. Debugging confirmed data was flowing to the component, but it was not visibly rendering. The root cause of the CVD chart not displaying was attributed to a misconfigured  condition, which was later removed. However, the chart still wasn't consistently visible.

Concurrently, a critical regression was identified in the backend: the  endpoint was returning a 500 error due to an ambiguous DataFrame truth value, a problem previously addressed in Phase 2. This suggests a reintroduction of an old bug in .

Given the persistent issues, the user initiated a significant product pivot. The AI engineer has since focused on gathering integration playbooks for the new non-custodial Solana trading dApp. Playbooks for Helius, Solana Wallet Adapter, Drift Protocol, and Jupiter have been successfully retrieved. The actual development of the new dApp has not yet begun.
